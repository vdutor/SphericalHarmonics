class SphericalHarmonicsLevel:

    Spherical harmonics \phi(x) in a specific dimension and degree (or level).

    The harmonics are constructed by
    1) Building a fundamental set of directions {v_i}_{i=1}^N,
        where N is number of harmonics of the degree.
        Given these directions we have that {c(<v_i, x>)}_i is a basis,
        where c = gegenbauer(degree, alpha) and alpha = (dimension - 2)/2.
        See Definition 3.1 in [1].
    2) Using Gauss Elimination we orthogonalise this basis, which
       corresponds to the Gram-Schmidt procedure.
